Defense Radar System (Python)
A Python-based defense radar system designed for detection and tracking of objects in a defined airspace. This project demonstrates the capabilities of radar systems using simulated data, processing radar signals, and visualizing results in real-time.

Features
Object Detection: Detects moving objects within the radar's range.
Tracking: Continuously tracks the detected objects' positions.
Simulation: Simulates radar signals and objects moving in a 2D space.
Real-time Visualization: Provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to display radar readings, object locations, and movement patterns.
Customizable Parameters: Allows for modification of radar parameters such as range, detection angle, and speed.
